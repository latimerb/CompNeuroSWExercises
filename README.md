# SoftwareTutorials

### This repository contains some exercises for understanding the basics of neuroscience from a computational perspective. The documents in the folder "Tutorial Docs" should serve as a guide for completing the exercises in the folder "HOC_SWTutorials". Ignore the "Old_Python" folder.

### Compiling mod files:

#### Some tutorials contain files with the .mod extension. These need to be compiled. On MAC/UNIX, assuming you have NEURON installed, open a terminal and change directory to where the .mod files reside then type nrnivmodl. On Windows, search your computer for an application called mknrndll and run it. Then navigate to where the .mod files are and compile them.
